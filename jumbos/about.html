            Hello!<br><br>
            Thank you for taking the time to look thorugh my work and consider me as a candidate.
            I am currently a junior at Tufts University, playing baseball while majoring in 
            Data Science and minoring in Computer Science, Entrepreneurship, and Finance. 
            I was born in Seoul, raised in Hong Kong, and attended The Pennington School in 
            New Jersey. My dad loved baseball. It was his childhood hobby growing up in Seoul 
            but had to give it up at 13 because of some misdiagnosed elbow pain. Ironically, 
            I ended up tearing my UCL at the end of my freshman year and underwent Tommy John 
            surgery at 16.<br><br>
            That journey of rehabbing really showed me my love for the game. Coming back from TJ 
            made me realize how much I loved baseball. I learned that I loved the process to sucess,
             no matter how tedious, grueling or painful it may be. With my growing love for numbers
              from clubs and the classroom, this position is the perfect bridge between my 
              experience as a player and my academic skills.
            <br><br>
              This submission builds on several projects I’ve worked on with the Tufts Baseball 
              Data Operations team and Baseball Analytics at Tufts (BAT), where we analyze team and
               league data to create scouting reports and uncover competitive advantages.
                One example is my TrackMan project from the spring, where I developed a webpage to
                 filter raw TrackMan data by team, pitcher, and hitter. This allowed us to identify 
                 a pitchers’ go-to pitches and spot opposing teams' approaches.
                 <br><br>
            My goal with this app was to build a tool that could help a team. By using filters to 
            visualize the data, we were able to uncover pitcher tendencies, patterns in strategy, 
            and hitter weaknesses. One key insight with this page is that <b>the data alone doesn’t 
                always tell the full story</b>. While certain patterns may seem clear, 
                they need to be interpreted alongside other variables to assess their 
                true usability and validity.
            <br><br>
            Thank you again for taking the time to go through my work. Looking forward to hearing 
            back from you.
            <br><br>
            Best,
            <br>
            Ronan Hwang
